# Flashdown

*Work in Progress*

Simple web-based spaced-repetition flashcard system built with Django.
Cards are edited/stored as Markdown (current supported extensions are
tables and fenced code blocks). You can also edit cards with LaTeX and
ascii MathML.

Current version can be found on [Heroku](http://flashdown-staging.heroku.com).

This was really more of an exercise to improve my Django / Python skills
and I probably won't do much more with it in the near future.
